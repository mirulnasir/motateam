Assuming you can even locate one for sale, today it would cost you somewhere in the region of $2,000,000 to put one in your garage.<\/p><p>The 993 GT2 was a stunner when it was unveiled. The already widened 993 Turbo<br\/>bodywork was stretched to almost cartoonish proportions thanks to the muscular looking fender flares that were fastened with exposed hardware, the wide rear end boasting a towering rear wing and the menacingly deep dish, plus the three-piece speedline wheels.<\/p><p>Before RWB-style cars were even a thing, Porsche was showing the way forward with this outrageous creation.<\/p><p>The GT2 tribute we have here is based on a 1978 930 Turbo, producing in the region of 400HP. It is finished in jet black which frankly is the only colour to have a GT2 in, it looks absolutely menacing and turns heads like no other.Â <\/p><p><\/p>",
